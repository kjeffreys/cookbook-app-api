Notes: (mostly commands run to remember that are useful/frequent)

# 1) Build from Dockerfile - "docker build ."

# 2) Build from docker-compose.yml - "docker-compose build"

# 3) Run commands using docker-compose:
    "docker-compose run {name of the service to run the command on} {command}"

#   ex1)```docker-compose run app sh -c "django-admin startproject app ."```
