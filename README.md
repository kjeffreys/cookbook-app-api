# cookbook-app-api

Notes: (mostly commands run to remember that are useful/frequent)

1) Build from Dockerfile - "docker build ."

2) Build from docker-compose.yml - "docker-compose build"

3) Run commands using docker-compose:
    # Service here refers to an entry under "services" in docker-compose.yml
    "docker-compose run {name of the service to run the command on} {command}"

    ex1)```docker-compose run app sh -c "django-admin startproject app ."```
    
    ... run a linux container created from the docker files, and then run...
    ... the command following, in this case from bash shell (sh -c), run ...
    ... the django admin management command "startproject" that comes    ...
    ... built-in with the Django pip install acquired from our req.txt,  ...
    ... and startproject creates the new project call "app", and         ...
    ... it does this startproject of app in the current directory        ...
    
    ... This process is run on the docker container, the path will be    ...
    ... based from the last "WORKDIR" set in "Dockerfile". So it's as    ...
    ... though we have used "cd into /app based on the Dockerfile, and   ...
    ... then we create a project (template code from django)             ...
